SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with relational databases. It allows you to:
	‚Ä¢	Query data using SELECT
	‚Ä¢	Filter with WHERE
	‚Ä¢	Sort with ORDER BY
	‚Ä¢	Group and aggregate with GROUP BY
	‚Ä¢	Modify data using INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
	‚Ä¢	Manage tables with TRUNCATE, DROP, CREATE, etc..

üìã Sample Table ‚Äì employees

Let‚Äôs use this example table:
emp_id	name	department	salary	hire_date
1	Alice	HR	50000	2021-01-15
2	Bob	IT	70000	2020-11-01
3	Charlie	IT	65000	2019-07-10
